One of the world's earliest civilizations, that of ancient Egypt, remains significant and important today for a number of reasons. A long, continuous record tells us much about Egyptian art, architecture, religion, and everyday life. Egyptians were a happy, optimistic, and conservative people. An awareness and love of nature were very much a part of their lives.

In ancient Egypt the king controlled everything, including the administration, the army, and the economy. The Old Kingdom, the Middle Kingdom, and the New Kingdom were the three periods of high achievement in the history of ancient Egypt. It was not until the late reigns of the New Kingdom that Pharaoh ("great house") was used to designate the king.

The influence of the early Egyptians extended well beyond their borders, into Greece and Rome.

The Western alphabet we use is derived from a Phoenician one which may have been modeled on Egyptian hieroglyphics. Developments in archaeology and historical writing have made the civilization of ancient Egypt accessible to the general public today.

Ancient Greece laid the foundation for the culture of the Western world. Arts, building, science, and philosophy were among the areas of Greek achievement. Balance and harmony were their guiding principles. The Greeks loved beauty and stressed the importance of language. Democracy arose in Greece along with the idea of the importance of the individual possessing dignity and rights.
