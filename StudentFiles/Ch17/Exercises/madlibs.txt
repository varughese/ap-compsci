Once there lived a <animal>. He was a very <adjective>
fellow.  The trouble was he did not know what he wanted to
be.  And so he kept sitting in the <place> thinking,
thinking...

But suddenly he saw fire.  He thought: <Exclamation>! 
He immediately ran to the <place> and dumped a jar of
<liquid> into the fire.  All the animals thought he
was a <adjective> person.
